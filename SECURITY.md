## Reporting a Vulnerability

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report a security vulnerability, email me at `officialmegatkc@gmail.com`. You can expect to get an update after 1 - 3 days. This may be longer. If this is a confirmed vulnerability, I will be releasing a security patch. If it isn't a confirmed vulnerability, I will email you that there are no vulnerabilties and everything will stay the same.
